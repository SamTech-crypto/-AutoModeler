# AutoModeler

**AutoModeler** is an intuitive, powerful tool designed to automate the creation of 3-statement financial models based on user inputs. With a simple and user-friendly interface, AutoModeler streamlines the financial planning process, making it easy for financial professionals, analysts, and decision-makers to generate detailed financial projections quickly.

Built with Python and Streamlit, AutoModeler enables users to input key financial assumptions, and it automatically generates comprehensive 3-statement models (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement). This helps reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and enhance decision-making accuracy.
